## Explorer Bonus Challenge 7

This project serves as a hands-on learning experience for practical concepts in JavaScript. The key focus areas in this project include:

- Object data structures
- Loop structures
- Function creation
- Comparative operators

### Challenge Details

To undertake this project, I followed the challenge outlined in this Notion link: [Explorer Bonus Challenge 7](https://efficient-sloth-d85.notion.site/Exerc-cio-02-41080263d073491a908e37c6e4145361).

### Project Structure

The project follows a simple structure, consisting of an `index.html` file and a `script.js` file. The `index.html` file is the entry point for running the script in a web browser, and the `script.js` file contains the JavaScript code for programming and implementing the specified concepts.
